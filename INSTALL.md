# Installation

A Makefile is included to compile the code.  You need make (e.g. GNU Make) 
and a Fortran compiler (e.g. gfortran).  First change the name of the
Makefile for your system, calling it Makefile.  Then, you can build the
code by typing:

```shell
make
```

And you can clean up the unneeded files by typing:

```shell
make clean
```

Full documentation and compiling instructions are available in PDF format in 
the doc directory.
